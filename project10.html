<h1>What Could Happen if Someone Sells Illegal Dvds?</h1>
<p class="red">A lousiana man has been sentenced to prison for 2 years for selling "pirated" dvds. Those dvds were movies and music albums. When he was investigated by the US Immigration, they found more than 1000 dvds and worth a retail estimate value of $12,890. He was selling them in his car near the parking lot in New Orleans.<a href="https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/louisiana-man-gets-2-years-prison-selling-pirated-movies-music">Source</a> </p>
