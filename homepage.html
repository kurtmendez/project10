    <p class="red">What I learned so far in this class is all about coding. Coding is making pages using the basic structure of a(n)
    HTML webpage. Making a website was difficult at first but later on, It was kind of easy to learn and to do. This exist because coding 
    can be used in so many different ways such as creating pages for a website.</p>
